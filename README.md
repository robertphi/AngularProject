# WIP Details
This app relies on a back-end, which I've worked on in a separate repo: https://github.com/robertphi/NodeServer
That Node server app should be running in order for this Angular app to work correctly ('http://localhost:3000/'). 

This is a heavy WIP. Most of the readme is auto-generated from Angular's CLI. For details on what this project aims to do, check the Wiki. 

# AngularProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Running tests

Run `npm run cypress:open` to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress. 

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
